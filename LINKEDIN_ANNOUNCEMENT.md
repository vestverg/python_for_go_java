Hey tech community! ðŸ‘‹

Just launched something cool - a Python guide specifically for Java and Go developers! ðŸš€ 

Ever tried switching from Java/Go to Python and got confused by the differences? Been there! That's why I created this tutorial that bridges the gap.

ðŸ’¡ What's inside:
â€¢ Modern Python features explained in Java/Go terms
â€¢ Real examples comparing patterns between languages
â€¢ Quick-start guides for each concept
â€¢ Full working project to practice with


Would love your feedback and contributions! ðŸ™Œ
