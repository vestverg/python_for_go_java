# ⚡ Concurrency in Python

## 📖 Overview

This section explores Python's concurrency features, including threading, multiprocessing, and asynchronous programming. Python's approach to concurrency differs significantly from Java and Go, with unique characteristics due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its async/await syntax.

### 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **Understanding the GIL**: How Python's Global Interpreter Lock affects threading
- **Threading Patterns**: I/O-bound tasks, producer-consumer, thread pools
- **Multiprocessing**: CPU-bound tasks, shared memory, process communication
- **Async/Await**: Event loops, coroutines, concurrent HTTP requests
- **Performance Optimization**: Choosing the right concurrency model
- **Debugging & Monitoring**: Tools and techniques for concurrent code
- **Production Patterns**: Real-world architectures and best practices

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Choose Your Path

**For I/O-bound tasks (file operations, network requests):**
```python
# Option 1: Threading (simple, good for most cases)
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    results = executor.map(fetch_url, urls)

# Option 2: AsyncIO (best for many concurrent operations)
import asyncio
async def main():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [fetch_async(session, url) for url in urls]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

**For CPU-bound tasks (calculations, data processing):**
```python
# Use multiprocessing for true parallelism
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    results = executor.map(cpu_intensive_function, data_chunks)
```

## 🎯 Learning Path

### Beginner (Java/Go Background)
1. Start with **[GIL and Concepts](docs/01-gil-and-concepts.md)** to understand Python's unique approach
2. Learn **[Threading](docs/02-threading.md)** for I/O-bound tasks
3. Practice with **examples/** to see practical implementations

### Intermediate
4. Master **[AsyncIO](docs/04-async-await.md)** for modern concurrent programming
5. Understand **[Multiprocessing](docs/03-multiprocessing.md)** for CPU-intensive work
6. Study **[Performance](docs/05-performance.md)** to optimize your code

### Advanced
7. Implement **[Production Patterns](docs/07-production-patterns.md)** in real applications
8. Use **[Debugging](docs/06-debugging.md)** techniques for complex issues
9. Reference **[Troubleshooting](docs/08-troubleshooting.md)** for specific problems

## 📁 Examples

The `examples/` directory contains practical implementations:

- **[threading_example.py](examples/threading_example.py)** - Worker threads with queues
- **[multiprocessing_example.py](examples/multiprocessing_example.py)** - CPU-intensive parallel processing  
- **[asyncio_example.py](examples/asyncio_example.py)** - Async HTTP requests and tasks

Run any example:
```bash
cd 07_concurrency/examples
python threading_example.py
python asyncio_example.py
python multiprocessing_example.py
```

## 🧪 Testing

Test the concepts you learn:
```bash
# Run concurrency tests
python -m pytest tests/test_concurrency.py -v

# Run specific test
python -m pytest tests/test_concurrency.py::test_threading_performance -v
```
