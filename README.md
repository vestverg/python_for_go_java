## Quick Start

1. **Install Python 3.8+**
   ```bash
   # Check if Python is installed
   python3 --version
   
   # Install if needed (varies by OS)
   # macOS: brew install python
   # Ubuntu: sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3
   # Windows: Download from python.org
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment** (Essential for Python development!)
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate          # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate             # On Windows Command Prompt
   venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1         # On Windows PowerShell
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # For development (includes testing, linting tools)
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. **Run examples**
   ```bash
   cd 01_getting_started/examples
   python hello.py
   ```

4. **Create new projects** (Use provided scripts)
   ```bash
   # Unix/Linux/macOS
   ./01_getting_started/examples/create_project.sh my_project
   
   # Windows PowerShell
   .\01_getting_started\examples\create_project.ps1 my_project
   ```
